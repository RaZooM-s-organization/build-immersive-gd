<cr>Important Note</c>: When you install the mod and restart the game for the first 
time it may show the error that mod is missing dll. This is geode issue. Restart 
the game **again** and mod should load without any problems!

___

<co>Important Note 2</c>: Mod is in **beta** version, so it doesn't have all 
the features yet. And existing features may change. Join my discord and leave your 
suggestions and feedback
