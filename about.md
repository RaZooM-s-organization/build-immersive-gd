# RaZooM's POV

<cy>Get inside the GD and control it with your body!</c>

- See the video of yourself right in the game
- Control the game character with your pose and movements

<cr>Important Note</c>: When you install the mod and restart the game for the first time it may show the error that mod is missing dll. This is geode issue. Restart the game **again** and mod should load without any problems!

<co>Important Note 2</c>: Mod is in early **beta** version, so it doesn't have all the features yet. And existing features may change. Join my discord and leave your suggestions and feedback



## Features

- Showing video inside tha game
- Real-time pose estimation
- Game control with the pose and movements

## Upcoming features (the highest priorities)

- Support for GPU to speed up pose estimation (DONE)
- Ability to add your own poses and edit existing ones
- Green screen support
- Less stupid name & logo


## How it works

- The video is captured from your web-cam
- Mod translates the video to the background of the level in GD
- Mod also includes a neural network, that estimates your pose in real time and depending on it controls your game character
